## Widgets that drive data (10 points // 5 points each)
- 1 point for creating a widget with a label
- 2 points for if the widget actually changes the data on the chart
- 2 points for using appropriate logic/syntax for changing the data (these points should be deducted if really verbose `if/else` syntax is used rather than filtering using the data values)

## Widgets that drive data or display (10 points // 5 points each)
- 1 point for creating a widget with a label
- 1 point for setting appropriate default value
- 3 points for the widget working (e.g., changing the desired output)


## Visual representation (15 points // 7.5 points each)
- 1 point for chart title (not needed if there is appropriate page labeling)
- 1 point for readable x label (not needed if a map)
- 1 point for readable y label (not needed if a map)
- 4 points for creating a graphic that "makes sense":
  - -2 if the encoding doesn't match the data type (e.g., a categorical color scale for continuous data)
  - -1 if axis ticks are unreadable (e.g., there are too many of them and they are overlapping)
  - -1 for an encoding (e.g., size or color) without a label or explanation
  - -1 for hover with the text "input$yvar" instead of the value
  

## Published on shiny (5 points)
- 5 points for getting it onto Shiny

## Layout (10 points)
- 5 points for creating a 2 page layout
- 2.5 points for using `sideBarLayout` on each page(or equivalently well organized display)
- -2 if the navigation tabs have meaningless titles (e.g., "Page one", "page two")
